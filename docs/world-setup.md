title: World Setup
---

When the server first boots, it will prompt you to setup an owner account and whether to setup the world or not.

If you denied the world setup prompt, you can run any of the following commands as an administrator after login:

```bash
[decorate
[doorgen
[signgen
[generatespawners felucca.json
```

### Next Steps

At this point you will have a fully spawned world with NPCs. You may want to run the `[save` command to persist the world to disk. Rolling world saves will happen periodically.
